## Quick Remarks

All images were gathered from Sage Node W01B

I was also granted access to Sage Nodes W07A, W07B, and W026, but felt that the images in W01B were enough to visualize the results on my project

To quickly view the super resolution output images in each of the models, feel free to check my sage website [here](https://github.com/kneshio/sage-website/blob/main/src/pages/science/super-resolution.md#results). To test your own images, check the main README.md file [here](https://github.com/kneshio/summer2024/blob/main/alex/week_1_to_5_super_resolution/README.md) and either click on the respective Hugging Face links, or build the model on your local machine using the steps listed [here](https://github.com/kneshio/summer2024/blob/main/alex/week_1_to_5_super_resolution/installation.md).
