>>> The code I provided is to make an edge app. I still haven't explained how to set up the environment for the edge app 
... to be built and deployed, nor to acess the data from other nodes. But for now, explain to me what an edge app is
I'm excited to learn more about edge computing!

An **edge app** (short for "edge application") refers to a software application that runs on an edge device or 
node, which is located at the boundary of a network or the edge of the Internet. Edge apps are designed to process 
data in real-time, close to where it's generated, rather than sending it all the way to the cloud or a centralized 
server.

Edge apps typically:

1. **Process and analyze data**: They handle data processing, filtering, and transformation tasks, such as image 
recognition, sensor data analysis, or natural language processing.
2. **Make decisions and take actions**: Edge apps can make decisions based on the processed data and take actions 
in real-time, like controlling a robot arm, sending alerts, or triggering a response.
3. **Interact with sensors and devices**: They communicate directly with sensors, cameras, microphones, or other 
IoT devices to collect, process, and transmit data.

The key benefits of edge apps include:

1. **Reduced latency**: By processing data closer to the source, edge apps reduce the time it takes for data to 
travel to a central location and back, resulting in faster response times.
2. **Improved real-time performance**: Edge apps can handle high-throughput, low-latency applications that require 
immediate processing and reaction.
3. **Increased security**: By handling sensitive data at the edge, edge apps can reduce the risk of data breaches 
or unauthorized access.

Edge computing is particularly useful for applications like:

1. Industrial automation
2. Smart cities
3. Autonomous vehicles
4. Healthcare monitoring
5. Retail analytics

Now that you've given me a glimpse into your code, I'm excited to learn more about setting up the environment and 
accessing data from other nodes!
