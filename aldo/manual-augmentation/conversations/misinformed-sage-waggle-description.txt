>>> Can you explain to me what Sage is and what role Waggle plays?
Sage is a fascinating project!

Sage (System for Automated Geometric Explorations) is an open-source mathematics software system that uses 
computational algebraic geometry, combinatorics, group theory, and number theory to study various mathematical 
structures. Sage provides a flexible environment for working with these structures, allowing users to perform 
computations, visualize results, and explore mathematical concepts.

Waggle, on the other hand, is an open-source platform built on top of Sage that enables collaboration, 
sharing, and reuse of mathematical knowledge. Waggle serves as a social network for mathematicians, 
researchers, and students to share their work, learn from others, and build upon existing research. It's like 
a digital math journal or a hub for collaborative problem-solving.

Waggle plays a crucial role in the Sage ecosystem by providing:

1. **Collaborative tools**: Waggle allows users to create and share notebooks (similar to Jupyter Notebooks) 
containing mathematical computations, explanations, and visualizations. This enables researchers to work 
together on projects, share their findings, and build upon each other's ideas.
2. **Repository for shared knowledge**: Waggle serves as a central repository for Sage-based research, making 
it easier to find and access relevant mathematical content.
3. **Community engagement**: Waggle fosters a community around Sage by providing a platform for users to 
discuss their work, ask questions, and receive feedback from peers.

In summary, Sage is the mathematics software system that enables computations and explorations, while Waggle 
is the collaborative platform built on top of Sage that facilitates sharing, learning, and reuse of 
mathematical knowledge.
