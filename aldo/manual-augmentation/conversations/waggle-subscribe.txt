>>> This is how you subscribe using pywaggle to receive data published by sensors on a Sage node:

...                 print("Another plugin published my.sensor.name value", msg.value)
... 
... Can you explain to me in detail what each line of code does? 
I'd be happy to break down the code for you.

**Line 1:** `from waggle.plugin import Plugin`

This line imports the `Plugin` class from the `waggle.plugin` module. Waggle is a Python library that provides 
an API for interacting with sensor data and other IoT-related tasks. The `Plugin` class is used to create a 
plugin that can connect to a Sage node (more on Sage nodes later) and subscribe to sensor data.

**Line 2:** `with Plugin() as plugin:`

This line creates a new instance of the `Plugin` class, which we'll refer to as `plugin`. The `with` statement 
is used to create a context manager that ensures the plugin is properly initialized and cleaned up when we're 
done with it. The `as plugin:` part assigns the plugin instance to a variable named `plugin`.

**Line 3:** `plugin.subscribe("my.sensor.name")`

This line tells the plugin to subscribe to a specific sensor data stream, which is identified by the string 
`"my.sensor.name"`. When you subscribe to a sensor, you're essentially saying, "Hey, I want to receive updates 
whenever this sensor publishes new data." The `subscribe` method sets up an internal subscription mechanism 
that will notify your code when new data becomes available.

**Line 4:** `while True:`

This line starts an infinite loop (i.e., a `while` loop with no condition). This means the code inside the 
loop will run indefinitely until you manually stop the program or encounter some kind of error.

**Line 5:** `msg = plugin.get()`

Inside the loop, this line calls the `get` method on the `plugin` instance. The `get` method retrieves the 
next available message from the subscribed sensor data stream. If no new data is available, it will block 
until new data becomes available (more on this later).

**Line 6:** `print("Another plugin published my.sensor.name value", msg.value)`

This line prints a message to the console indicating that another plugin has published new data for the 
`"my.sensor.name"` sensor. The `msg` variable contains the actual data published by the sensor, and we're 
printing its value using the `.value` attribute.

Now, let's talk about Sage nodes!

A Sage node is a type of node in the Waggle ecosystem that acts as an intermediary between sensors and other 
plugins or applications. Think of it like a broker that helps match requests with available data sources. When 
you subscribe to sensor data on a Sage node using the `Plugin` class, you're essentially asking the node to 
notify your plugin whenever new data becomes available from that specific sensor.

In this code, we create a new plugin instance and use its `subscribe` method to register interest in receiving 
data from the `"my.sensor.name"` sensor. The `get` method is used to retrieve the next available message from 
the subscribed sensor data stream.
