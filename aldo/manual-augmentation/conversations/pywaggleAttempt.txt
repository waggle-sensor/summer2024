I was mistaken earlier!

The imports you provided are indeed the correct ones for using Pywaggle to capture an 
image from a camera:

```
from waggle.plugin import Plugin
from waggle.data.vision import Camera
import time
```

Here's what each of these imports does:

* `Plugin` is the base class for Waggle plugins, which are used to extend Waggle's 
functionality. In this case, you're using it as a starting point for your 
camera-capturing plugin.
* `Camera` is part of Waggle's vision module, which provides an interface to cameras 
connected to your system. This is where you'll find the functionality to capture 
images from your camera.
* `time` is a built-in Python library that allows you to work with time-related tasks, 
such as waiting for a certain amount of time before capturing another image.

With these imports, you should be able to create a Pywaggle plugin that captures 
images from a camera using the `Camera` class and manages the timing using the `time` 
library.

... from waggle.data.vision import Camera
... import time
... Provide me code that can capture an image from the camera
Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can use Pywaggle to capture a 
snapshot from a camera:

```python
from waggle.plugin import Plugin
from waggle.data.vision import Camera
import time

class SnapshotPlugin(Plugin):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.camera = Camera()

    def start(self):
        while True:
            # Capture an image and store it in the Waggle database
            img = self.camera.capture()
            pw_image = pw.Image.from_array(img, 'rgb')
            pw_database.store(pw_image)

            # Wait for 1 second before taking the next snapshot
            time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    plugin = SnapshotPlugin()
    plugin.start()
```

In this code:

* We define a `SnapshotPlugin` class that inherits from Waggle's `Plugin` base class.
* In the `start` method, we create an instance of the `Camera` class and use its 
`capture` method to take a snapshot. The captured image is then converted into a 
Waggle-compatible `Image` object using the `pw.Image.from_array` method.
* The captured image is stored in the Waggle database using the `store` method of the 
`pw_database`.
* We use a loop that runs indefinitely, capturing and storing snapshots at 1-second 
intervals.

When you run this code, it will continuously capture snapshots from your camera and 
store them in the Waggle database.
